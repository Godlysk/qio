title: Introduction

A _real world_ program needs to deal with **side-effects**, **non determinism** and **exceptions**. Unfortunately Javascript doesn't provide us with a first class support to handle any of these problems fairly. **QIO** provides a set of type-safe abstraction that can help solve these problems elegantly.

Next we will try to understand these concepts a bit more. If you know them already you can directly skip to [tutorial], though its recommended to go through the introduction.
