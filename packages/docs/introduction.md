A _real world_ program needs to deal with **side-effects**, **non determinism** and **exceptions**. Unfortunately apart from throwing and catching exceptions, Javascript doesn't provide us with a first class support to handle non-determinism and side-effects. **QIO** provides a set of solid type-safe abstraction that can help solve these problems elegantly.

Next we will try to understand these concepts in a bit more detail. If you know these concepts already you can directly skip to [usage], though its recommended to go through the introduction.
