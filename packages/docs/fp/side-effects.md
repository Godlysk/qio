title: Side Effects
---

Side effects are changes that your program performs to the outside world, for eg.:

1. Writing to a database.
2. Taking input from a user.
3. Making an HTTP call.
4. Render an image on a screen etc.

A program that performs no side-effects has no practical usage. For eg. a program that multiplies two numbers and simply holds the result is pretty much useless, unless the numbers are inputted by the user and the output is printed on the screen.
